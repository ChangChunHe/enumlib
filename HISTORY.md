# Revision History for `enumlib`

## Initial Repository: Revision 0.0.0

The first few commits were to get the repo up to scratch and nice and clean with installation instructions etc. This includes the commit for new revision number 0.0.0. It includes an update of the `*.xml` files defining the unit tests so that they work with the distribution directory's structure.
